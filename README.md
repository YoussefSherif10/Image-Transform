# Image-Transform
In this project, I used the pixel and PNG classes to transform an image in several ways.
HSLAPixel class contains four public member variables: h, storing the hue of the pixel - s, storing the saturation of the pixel - l, storing the luminance of the pixel - a, storing the alpha channel.
I used the widely-used C++ testing framework Catch.
I used an already complete PNG class that saves and loads PNG files and exposes a simple API for you to modify PNG files. It has methods for loading and saving PNG files, For retrieving pixel and image information, Methods for creating empty PNGs, resizing an image, etc.
the image manipulation functions themselves in ImageTransform.cpp.
